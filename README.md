Overview
MediTrack is a decentralized application (dApp) built to revolutionize the medical supply chain. By leveraging blockchain technology, it provides an immutable, transparent, and highly traceable system for tracking medical supplies from their manufacturing origin to the end-user. This project demonstrates a robust full-stack application built with Next.js and integrates seamlessly with Ethereum smart contracts and IPFS for decentralized data storage.

The Problem
The global medical supply chain is critically compromised by a pervasive lack of verifiable transparency and immutable traceability, directly enabling the widespread proliferation of counterfeit and substandard medications. This systemic vulnerability poses an existential threat to patient safety, erodes public trust in healthcare, and inflicts severe financial and reputational damage upon legitimate pharmaceutical stakeholders.

Patients unknowingly consume ineffective or harmful drugs.
Manufacturers struggle with product diversion, recalls, and brand damage.
Distributors risk circulating falsified goods due to unreliable verification.
Healthcare Providers lack tools for instant medication authentication.
Regulatory Bodies are hindered by fragmented, opaque data, limiting effective oversight.
The Solution
MediTrack addresses these challenges by creating a single source of truth for medical product provenance. Every significant event in a product's lifecycle (e.g., manufacturing, shipping, receiving, dispensing) is recorded as a transaction on the Ethereum blockchain via smart contracts. This creates an immutable and tamper-proof audit trail that all authorized participants can verify.

The dApp provides intuitive interfaces for different roles within the supply chain, ensuring transparency and accountability at every step and significantly reducing the risk of counterfeit medications entering the legitimate market.

Features
Immutable Transaction Logging: Utilizes Solidity smart contracts on Ethereum to record every supply chain event, ensuring data integrity and tamper-proof records.
QR Code Verification: Allows stakeholders (e.g., pharmacists, patients) to scan a product's QR code to instantly retrieve its complete, verified history and authenticity details.
Decentralized Document Storage: Stores crucial documents and certificates (e.g., batch records, quality control reports) on IPFS, ensuring data persistence and accessibility without relying on centralized servers.
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Implements distinct access levels for Manufacturers, Distributors, and Retailers (e.g., pharmacies, hospitals), allowing them to perform specific actions relevant to their role while maintaining data privacy.
MetaMask Integration: Provides secure and decentralized user authentication and transaction signing.
Product Lifecycle Tracking: Tracks products from raw material sourcing (conceptual) through manufacturing, packaging, shipment, distribution, and final dispensation to the end-user.

Frontend (Next.js): Handles user interaction, state management, and makes API calls to its own backend routes.
Next.js API Routes: Act as a bridge, abstracting direct blockchain interactions, handling IPFS uploads, and potentially managing server-side data for enhanced features (e.g., caching, indexed search if needed).
Smart Contracts (Solidity): The core logic for tracking product events, ownership transfers, and enforcing supply chain rules, residing immutably on the Ethereum blockchain.
IPFS: Used for storing off-chain data that's too large or not suitable for direct blockchain storage (e.g., PDF certificates, high-res images). Hashes of IPFS content are stored on the blockchain for verification.
MetaMask: Enables users to connect their Ethereum wallets, sign transactions, and authenticate with the dApp.
Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up and run MediTrack locally for development and testing.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js (LTS version): Download & Install Node.js
npm or Yarn: (Comes with Node.js, or install Yarn: npm install -g yarn)
Git: Download & Install Git
MetaMask Browser Extension: Install MetaMask
Basic understanding of blockchain, Ethereum, and Solidity.
An Infura project ID: Sign up at Infura.io to get an API key for a testnet (e.g., Sepolia).
Some test ETH: Obtain from a faucet for your chosen testnet (e.g., Sepolia Faucet).
Installation
Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/meditrack.git
cd meditrack
Install frontend dependencies:

Bash

npm install # or yarn install
Install smart contract dependencies (if in a separate folder, e.g., contracts):

Bash

cd contracts # or wherever your smart contract project resides
npm install # or yarn install
cd ..
(Note: You might integrate Hardhat/Truffle commands directly into your main package.json for simplicity in a monorepo setup.)

Set up environment variables:
Create a .env.local file in the root of your project and add the following, replacing placeholders with your actual values:

Code snippet

# Next.js Application Port
PORT=3000

# Infura Project ID (for connecting to Ethereum network)
NEXT_PUBLIC_INFURA_PROJECT_ID=YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID

# Private Key of your deployment wallet (ONLY for development/testnet)
# BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL WITH PRIVATE KEYS IN PRODUCTION!
PRIVATE_KEY=YOUR_ETHEREUM_PRIVATE_KEY_FOR_DEPLOYMENT

# Ethereum Network to connect to (e.g., sepolia, goerli)
ETHEREUM_NETWORK=sepolia

# Smart Contract Address (will be populated after deployment)
NEXT_PUBLIC_MEDI_TRACK_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=
PRIVATE_KEY: This is needed for deploying your smart contracts to a testnet. For a portfolio, a testnet private key is acceptable. Never use a private key for a mainnet wallet with real funds in a public repository.
NEXT_PUBLIC_INFURA_PROJECT_ID: Your project ID from Infura.
ETHEREUM_NETWORK: The testnet you're using (e.g., sepolia).
NEXT_PUBLIC_MEDI_TRACK_CONTRACT_ADDRESS: This will be filled in after you deploy your smart contracts.
Running Locally
Compile and Deploy Smart Contracts:
Navigate to your smart contract directory (e.g., contracts) and run the deployment script.

Bash

cd contracts # or equivalent
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network sepolia # or your chosen network
After successful deployment, copy the deployed contract address and paste it into your NEXT_PUBLIC_MEDI_TRACK_CONTRACT_ADDRESS variable in .env.local.

Start the Next.js Development Server:
Navigate back to the project root and start the development server.

Bash

npm run dev # or yarn dev
Access the Application:
Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 (or the port specified in your .env.local).

Connect MetaMask:
Ensure your MetaMask wallet is connected to the same Ethereum testnet you deployed your contracts to. You'll use MetaMask to interact with the dApp.

Smart Contract Details
(This section is crucial for a blockchain project. You'll expand on this once you've written your Solidity contracts.)

The core logic of MediTrack resides in its Solidity smart contracts.

MediTrack.sol (or similar): This contract manages the creation of new products, tracking their state changes (e.g., Manufactured, Shipped, Received, Dispensed), and recording ownership transfers.
Key Functions:
addProduct(...): Registers a new medical product on the blockchain.
transferOwnership(...): Records the transfer of a product between entities (manufacturer to distributor, distributor to retailer).
recordEvent(...): Logs significant events like quality checks, recalls, or dispense actions.
getProductHistory(...): Retrieves the full, immutable history of a specific product.
Role-Based Access Control: The contract implements modifiers or access control mechanisms to ensure only authorized roles (e.g., a registered manufacturer) can perform specific actions (e.g., addProduct).
(You would typically link to your contract's source code on GitHub here and potentially an Etherscan link for the deployed contract.)

Deployment
MediTrack is designed for easy deployment to modern hosting platforms.

Frontend & Next.js API Routes: Deployed to platforms like Vercel or Netlify for optimal performance and developer experience with Next.js.
Smart Contracts: Deployed to a public Ethereum testnet (e.g., Sepolia) via Infura, and eventually to Ethereum Mainnet for a production environment.
IPFS: Data is pinned to a service like Pinata or a self-hosted IPFS node to ensure persistence.
Future Enhancements
As a portfolio project, MediTrack has vast potential for expansion:

Advanced Analytics & Reporting: Dashboard for manufacturers to visualize supply chain data, identify bottlenecks, or track market penetration.
Integration with IoT Devices: Automated data capture from sensors (e.g., temperature, humidity) for sensitive medical products, recorded on-chain.
Regulatory Compliance Modules: Features specifically designed to meet regulations like DSCSA (US) or EU FMD.
Off-chain Data Indexing: Implement a dedicated indexing solution (e.g., The Graph) for more complex querying and faster data retrieval that is not possible directly from the blockchain.
Cross-Chain Compatibility: Explore bridging to other blockchains for broader reach.
Tokenization of Products: Represent individual products as NFTs for unique identification and ownership.
Advanced User Interface: Richer UI/UX with real-time updates and notifications.
